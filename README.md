## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the praevia application on your local machine for development or via Docker for a production-like environment.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

* **Python:** Version 3.12 or newer.
* **pip:** Python package installer (comes with Python).
* **Git:** Version control system.
* **Docker & Docker Compose:** (Required for production setup or Dockerized development).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/isaacaisha/praevia.git](https://github.com/isaacaisha/praevia.git)
    cd praevia_app
    ```

2.  **Set up a Python Virtual Environment (Recommended for Development):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Python Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Configuration

Environment variables are used to manage sensitive data and settings.

1.  **Create `.env` file:** Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` in your project root (`~/praevia`):
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2.  **Edit `.env` file:** Open the newly created `.env` file and fill in your specific values.

    ```dotenv
    # Required Django Secret Key (generate a strong, random one)
    SECRET_KEY=your_super_secret_key_here_for_security

    # Set to False for production environments for security
    DEBUG=True 

    # Allowed hosts for your Django application (e.g., localhost, your_domain.com, your_server_ip)
    ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1

    # Database Settings (PostgreSQL is recommended and used in Docker)
    DB_NAME=praevia_db
    DB_USER=praevia_user
    DB_PASSWORD=praevia_password
    DB_HOST=localhost # 'db' if using docker-compose for development, 'localhost' for local dev without docker db
    DB_PORT=5432

    # Google reCAPTCHA Keys (Obtain from [https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/))
    RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY=your_recaptcha_site_key_goes_here
    RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY=your_recaptcha_secret_key_goes_here

    # Email Settings (for password reset, 2FA setup, etc.)
    EMAIL_BACKEND=django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend
    EMAIL_HOST=smtp.your-email-provider.com
    EMAIL_PORT=587
    EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
    EMAIL_HOST_USER=your_email@example.com
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your_email_password
    DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
    ```
    **Security Note:** Never commit your actual `.env` file to version control. It contains sensitive credentials.

3.  **Run Database Migrations:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

4.  **Create a Superuser (Admin Account):**
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
    Follow the prompts to create your administrative user account.

### Running the Application

#### Development (using Django's built-in server)

To quickly get the application running for development:

```bash
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8079
```
